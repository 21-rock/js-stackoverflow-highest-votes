## Introduction

This is a curation list of `#javascript#` questions with highest votes on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/javascript?sort=votes).

It's been a long time since one day in 2014 the idea occurred to me that wrapping up JavaScript things I've learned for the last two years.

Finally, today, I start to do it.

I've read those **JavaScript Bibles** like `<JavaScript: The Definitive Guide>`, `<JavaScript: The Good Parts>`, `<Eloquent JavaScript>`. And I've done with several projects with so-called **modern JavaScript** like MVC, isomorphic, etc.

But still, there are a lot of unsolved questions and mysteries in my mind about JavaScript.

I need to figure them out. Not only the answers, but also the questions themseves.

#### Why Stack Overflow?
Because it's the `WikiPedia`(knowledge base) for the world of programmers.

More importantly, the questions and answers themselves are best examples for me to learn
how to issue a good question and how to write a good answer.

We need to ask questions, and we need to learn how to ask.

Writing an answer is a test to see how much you understand the problem. And actually, most of the time it's a second round learning for yourself to get better understanding for the problem.

#### Why highest votes?
I decided to pick up the questions with `highest votes`
other than `most frequently asked` is because **vote** means people feel the same for the problem and want the answer to it as well.

A question with highest votes means that it has been a pain point for most javascript programmers. So I believe it's worth figuring it out.
